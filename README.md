## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is my first time using a local data.json file, I had to do some research to get going. But it was a fun exercise, Also my first time using a figma template, and it made the challenge a whole lot easier.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I found it extremely difficult to change between portrait and landscape images on the mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes, I used some terrible javascript to get it to work, I would really like to improve on that

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tVCwv_BX2M&t=13s) - This helped me to understand how to access a local data.json file
